",,"Blanket State is a type of State that partition Internal State from External State ","California is the State with the best honey on the West Coast. ","111. Situation, Condition, State (from here)

The words, situation and condition, imply, something accidental, and transitory; with this difference, that situation, respects outward circumstances; condition, those, within the matter referred to; whereas, that of state,implies, something, more habitual, and lasting.

We, generally, use the word, situation, as relative, to affairs, rank or fortune; condition, with respect, to the nature, quality or property of a thing; and that, of state, applying it to health, or, our well or ill-being.

We say, our situation is bad; when we are surrounded with difficulties: that a building is in bad condition; when out of repair; and, that some persons enjoy but an indifferent state of health.

An ill-state of health, added to a bad situation of affairs, is a condition, into which, every man must, naturally, dread the falling.

Such is the condition, and vicissitude of human life, that, the most prudent men, have, often, found themselves in perplex|ing situations; and from a state of happiness, have, as it were, through the perverseness of fortune, fallen into one most wretched and deplorable."
Core,Bayesian Statistics,Stationarity,"Of a Random variable , that it is described by parameters that are drawn from a  Gaussian distribution and unchanging over the time horizon of analysis. ",,A common assumption of many time series algorithms is that the data exhibits Stationarity.,I am exhibiting Stationarity when I stop walking.,"A common assumption in many time series techniques is that the data are at Stationarity .

A stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time. Stationarity can be defined in precise mathematical terms, but for our purpose we mean a flat looking series, without trend, constant variance over time, a constant autocorrelation structure over time and no periodic fluctuations (seasonality).

For practical purposes, stationarity can usually be determined from a run sequence plot.

Core,Bayesian Statistics,Surprise,"In Bayesian Inference, Surprise is the negative log evidence, directly corresponding to the inverse of probability (high probability, low surprisal; low probability, high surprisal). The proxy that bounds surprisal is the difference between Prior and Posterior Distribution — how “surprising” Sensory Data are to the Generative Model of the Agent.","Surprise (also known as Surprisal or self-Information), is a quantity that, according to the Free Energy Principle, must be minimized in order for an Agent to survive; Variational Free Energy provides an upper bound on Surprisal and is minimized instead of minimizing Surprisal directly.

",Surprisal cannot be minimized directly because it is involves calculating the Evidence term in Bayes’ Rule which generally involves an intractable integral over all possible states an organism can be in.,"When they walk into the room, yell “Surprise“!

The Free Energy Principle is a more general statement about specific kinds of self-organization in random Non-linear dynamical systems assuming that these systems have certain properties like Ergodicity (weakly mixing) and a Markov Blanket. According to the Free Energy Principle, systems that minimize Variational Free Energy will maintain their low (thermodynamic) Entropy structure through Autopoiesis in the face of random fluctuations in the environment.

Supplement,,High road,"One of two roads (arguments) that lead to the Free Energy Principle as a possible conclusion which starts with philosophical questions about what properties a thing must have to “exist” (i.e. it must be measurable) and then uses principles of Autopoiesis and non-equilibrium Thermodynamic systems from a statistical perspective to show what kinds of systems could continue to maintain themselves over time (see Friston 2019: Beyond the Desert Landscape and the other road, the Low road ).

“The high road stands in for a top-down approach that starts by asking fundamental questions about the necessary properties things must possess if they exist. Using mathematical (variational) principles, once can then show that existence is an embodied exchange of a creatures with its environment - that necessarily entails predictive processing as one aspect of self-evidencing mechanics.”",,The High road to the Free Energy Principle starts by talking about random Non-linear dynamical systems in general without a specific focus on biological organisms with brains.,You take the High road and I’ll take the low road.,"The High road connects a number of different fields together, drawing from concepts of Autopoiesis and self-organization within random Non-linear dynamical systems who are proposed to be in Non-Equilibrium Steady State with respect to the environment. Under certain Ergodicity assumptions about such systems it is possible to show how the Free Energy Principle arises."

Supplement,,"Low road ","One of two roads (arguments) that lead to the Free Energy Principle as a possible conclusion which starts with fundamental questions from neuroscience and psychology about the nature of perception in biological organisms within a changing environment (see Friston 2019: Beyond the Desert Landscape and the other road, the High road ).

“The low road is to pursue the agenda established by Kant and Helmholtz to generalize - in a bottom up way - the capacity for inference and prediction to see how far it takes us in understand embodied exchange with the environment.”",,"The Low road  to the Free Energy Principle starts by looking at how biological organisms perceive their environment and take actions within it to develop a notion about how they can successfully predict the next state they will be in (Perception as Hypothesis testing). ","Be careful, the Low road  can be dangerous.",

Supplement,Bayesian Statistics,Approximate Posterior,"A probability distribution (often denoted by ""q"") used in Variational Bayesian Inference to approximate the true (but unknown) Posterior distribution.

",,"The parameters of the approximate posterior distribution are adjusted until the shape of the distribution matches the true Posterior distribution, as measured by Kullback-Leibler Divergence.",In Bayesian Inference we can solve Bayes’ theorem directly to obtain the Approximate Posterior.,"We cannot usually solve Bayes’ theorem because we must evaluate the model evidence term needed to normalize the product of the Likelihood and Prior. We can optimize the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the Approximate Posterior and Posterior through a proxy functional, Variational Free Energy, which is the upper bound on Surprisal (negative log model evidence)."
