Core	Non-Equilibrium Steady State	Technically, a Non-Equilibrium Steady State requires a solution to the Fokker Planck equation (i.e., density dynamics). A nonequilibrium steady-state solution entails solenoidal (i.e., conservative or divergence free) dynamics that break detailed balance (and underwrite stochastic chaos ). In other words, The dynamics of systems at Non-Equilibrium Steady State are not time reversible (unlike equilibrium steady states, in which the flow is entirely dissipative).	Generally, a Non-Equilibrium Steady State refers to a System with dynamics that are unchanging, or at Stationarity in some State.
Core	Novelty	The Internal State assumed by an Agent‘s epistemic Affordance, when unable to immediately (e.g. locally) resolve Uncertainty about the contingencies — i.e. the opportunity to resolve Uncertainty about ‘what would happen if I did that?’ (The Precision of this assumed Internal State has a distinctive, e.g. multimodal, distribution, i.e. exhibits Ambiguity .)	
Core	Observation	The Belief updating of an Internal State registered by a Sensory input, given the weighting assigned to that class of input in comparison with weighting of the competing Priors. (This is a narrow sense of “observation,” where the Agent is “looking for this kind of input.” This sense excludes situations where (a) an incoming stimulus with these attributes has already been explained-away or pre-discounted, or (b) the prior is so strongly weighted as to exclude updating in response to any inputs (other than, perhaps, “catastrophic” ones, as may occur in e.g. fainting, hysterical blindness).)	Any Sensory input, either discrete-valued or continuous-valued. (This is a broad sense.)
Core	Particle	An Agent consisting of Blanket States and Internal State , partitioned off from Niche .	
Core	Perception	Posterior State Inference after each new Observation.	
Core	Policy	Sequence of Actions, reflected by series of Active States as implemented in Policy selection which is Action prediction or Action and Planning as Divergence Minimization

Core	Pragmatic value	Pragmatic value is the benefit to an organism of a given Policy or Action , measured in terms of probability of a Policy leading to Expectation of Random variable values that are aligned with the Preference of the Agent	Pragmatic value describes the extent to which a given action is aligned with rewarding preferences over sensory outcomes.
Core	Prediction	An Estimator about a State in a Model at a future time.

Core	Prior	The initial or preceding state of a Belief in Bayesian Inference, before Sensory Data (Observation or Evidence ) occurs.	
Core	Process Theory	Dynamic or mechanistic Model or framework that is consistent with a broader or non-mechanistic/non-operational Principle, such as the Free Energy Principle .	
Core	Recognition Model	Recognition Model is the kind of Model that affords Variational Inference, which lets us calculate or approximate a probability distribution. Recognition Model is a synonym for Variational Model.	
Core	Regime of Attention	feedback mechanisms between practices in a Culture of scaffolding individuals’ Attention, that guide Agents’ style of Attention; act as determined by bodily, language, and contextual Cues in a given community; and are encoded in higher levels of the cortical hierarchy.	
Core	Representation	A structural correspondence between some Random variable inside a System and some Random variable outside the System (isomorphism being the strongest kind of correspondence), such that the Systemengages in Inference carried out by the System maintains the correspondence	
Core	Salience	The extent to which a Cue commands the Attention of an Agent given their Regime of Attention	
Core	Sense States	In the Friston Blanket formalism, the Blanket States are the Sense States (incoming Sensory input) and Active States (outgoing influence of Policy selection )

Core	State space	Set of variables/parameters that describe a System .	A state space is the set of all possible configurations of a system
Core	Stationarity	Of a Random variable , that it is described by parameters that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution and unchanging over the time horizon of analysis.	
Core	Surprise	In Bayesian Inference , the difference between Prior and Posterior Distribution — how “surprising” Sensory Data are to the Generative model of the Agent	
Core	System	Set of relations described by State space of a Model .	Differentiable and Integratable in terms of Variables and functions.
Core	Temporal Depth	The length of a time window or horizon considered (longer time → deeper / more Temporal Depth )	
Core	Uncertainty	In Bayesian Inference , a measure of the Expectation of Surprise (Entropy) of a Random variable (associated with its variance or inverse Precision )	
Core	Variational	Biologically: Said of the behavior of aNeuronal Ensemble that minimizes the error of quantities selected by that ensemble, by implementing an algorithm that approximates calculus of variations.	Mathematically: Using calculus of variationsto find functions that optimize the values of quantities that depend on those functions.
